# CIFAR-100 Image Classification - Project 2

This project is part of the coursework for the *Image and Video Technology and Analysis* class. It focuses on comparative evaluation and practical implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the CIFAR-100 dataset. The implemented model performs classification on a subset of 20 selected fine-label classes from CIFAR-100.
